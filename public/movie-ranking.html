<h1>The Best Movies According to Jayla</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This was one of the first Studio Ghibli films I ever watched. It has beautiful animation and an amazing soundtrack.</p>
<h3>Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>This is an inspiring film that also features a great soundtrack and a unique animation style that seemlessly combined 2D and 3D animation.</p>
<h3>Mean Girls</h3>
<p>This is a fun film that perfectly encapsulates early 2000s youth and pop culture.</p>
